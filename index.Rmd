Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Strategic Management and Organization Theory at the department of [Management and Entrepreneurship](https://kelley.iu.edu/faculty-research/departments/management-entrepreneurship/index.html), [Kelley School of Business](https://kelley.iu.edu/), [Indiana University Bloomington](https://indiana.edu/).


My current research interest lies at the intersection of strategy and organization theory, with a particular focus on questions at the business-society interface. 

You can contact me via [joli@iu.edu](joli@iu.edu)<br>
