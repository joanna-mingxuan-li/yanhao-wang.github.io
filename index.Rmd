Hi! Welcome to my website!

I got my Bachelor degree in Finance and Masters degree in Economics from [Antai College of Economics and Management](http://www.acem.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). I was also an exchange student at [Smith School of Business](https://smith.queensu.ca/index.php), [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca/). 

I'm doing research at the intersection of empirical industrial organization and financial markets. I'm also interested in economic development and applied econometrics.
